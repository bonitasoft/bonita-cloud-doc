== Launching a deployment

. If your project contains applications created with xref:bonita:ROOT:applications/ui-builder/bonita-ui-builder[Bonita UI Builder], ensure that the UIB application files (`.json`) are placed inside the `uib/` directory in your Git repository.
. Click on the image:jenkins-play-button.png[CDPlayButton] of the "ACTION - Deploy a LivingApp to a non-production runtime" job.
. Your default deploy configuration will be pre-loaded. If needed you can change it.
. You still need to select the build you want to deploy.
You have several possibilities:
 ** Last successful build
 ** Specific build
 ** Last Saved build
 ** Upstream that triggered this job
 ** Downstream build of
 ** Last build with artifacts
 ** Last completed build
 ** Specified by permalink
 ** Copy from WORKSPACE of the latest completed build
. Select the target runtime (note that only non-production runtimes are available - to deploy in production see xref:living-application/deploy-in-prod-with-bonita-cloud.adoc[here])
. You can specify the directory that contains the xref:living-application/test-a-living-application.adoc[integration tests] with the INTEGRATION_TESTS_DIR optional field.
. You can also select xref:{bcdVersion}@bcd:ROOT:deployer.adoc#preconfigured_deployment_policies[the deployment policies] to apply.

. For troubleshooting purposes, you can activate the "Debug_mode" option to activate the debug verbose mode.
. Click on the build button (lower left).
. You should see the job progress and steps.

=== (optional) Load a custom Deployment Descriptor file

The BCD deploy command allows to add and extra parameter named `deploy.json` to specify which resources have to be deployed, and with which policy.
See xref:{bcdVersion}@bcd:ROOT:deployer.adoc#deployment_descriptor_file[Deploy Living App artifacts | Deployment Descriptor file] for more info.

When used, if a deploy policy is declared in DEPLOY_JSON, it overrides the other Development or Production Policies.

To use the deployment descriptor, enter the content of the deploy.json in the `DEPLOY_JSON` optional field.

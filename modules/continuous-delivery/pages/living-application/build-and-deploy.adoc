== Launching a deployment

. If your project contains applications created with xref:bonita:ROOT:applications/ui-builder/bonita-ui-builder[Bonita UI Builder], ensure that the UIB application files (`.json`) are placed inside the `uib/` directory in your Git repository.
. Click on the image:jenkins-play-button.png[CDPlayButton] of the "ACTION - Build and Deploy a LivingApp to a non-production runtime" job.
. Your default build and deploy configuration will be pre-loaded. If needed you can change it (includes the repository URL and branch)
. Select the target AppRuntime (note that only non-production AppRuntimes are available - to deploy in production see xref:living-application//deploying-to-bonita-cloud.adoc[here])
. If needed, you can fill xref:{bcdVersion}@bcd:ROOT:deployer.adoc#deployment_descriptor_file[the Deployment Descriptor] in the DEPLOY_JSON field to specify which resources have to be deployed, and with which policy. When used, if a deploy policy is declared in DEPLOY_JSON, it overrides the Development or Production Policies.
. You can specify the directory that contains the xref:living-application/test-a-living-application.adoc[integration tests] with the INTEGRATION_TESTS_DIR optional field.
. You can also select the deployment policies to apply. Warning: It may be overridden by policies inside DEPLOY_JSON.

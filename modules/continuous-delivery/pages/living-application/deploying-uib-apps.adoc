[NOTE]
====
This job is **automatically launched** as part of the LivingApp deployment process.  
You **do not need to trigger this job manually** unless they want to **deploy UIB applications only** without redeploying the LivingApps.
====

== Prerequisites

Ensure that the UIB application files (`.json`) are placed inside the `uib/` directory in your Git repository.

. Click on the image:jenkins-play-button.png[CDPlayButton] of the **"ACTION - Deploy UIB application files"** job.
. Your default build configuration will be pre-loaded. If needed, you can modify it (repository URL, branch, etc.).
. Select the target runtime.
. Click on the build button (lower left).
. Monitor the job execution.

== Result of a deployment

=== Successful Deployment

If the job completes successfully, you will be able to access your Bonita UI Builder applications.

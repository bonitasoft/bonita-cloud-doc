[#repository_credentials]
== Git repository credentials
// BCD page is deleted on 4.0, that's why we need to hardcode the 3.6 version
This job allows you to configure your access to Git but also the xref:3.6@bcd:ROOT:how_to_use_bcd_with_data_encrypted.adoc[BCD vault password].

. Click on the image:continuous-delivery:jenkins-play-button.png[CDPlayButton] of the "Configure my credentials" job.

CAUTION: If your Git repository is hosted on GitHub.com, beginning August 13, 2021 password-based authentication will no longer be accepted. Instead, token-based authentication will be required using a https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token[personal access token]. Therefore you will have to enter your GitHub username in the **bonitaGitUsername** field and your authentication token in the **bonitaGitPassword** field of the "Configure my credentials" job.

== Maven repository credentials

This job lets you manage your private Maven repositories by adding, updating, or deleting repository configurations.

.Parameters:
* *configurations* :: Select an existing configuration or add a new one by choosing _Add new maven repo_.
* *url* :: URL for your private Maven repository (required for add/update).
* *username* :: Username for authentication (optional).
* *password* :: Password for authentication (optional).
* *remove* :: Select “yes” to delete the selected repository (only enabled for existing configs).

. Click on the image:continuous-delivery:jenkins-play-button.png[CDPlayButton] of the "Configure my private Maven repository" job.
. Fill in the parameters as described above.
. Click on the "Build" button to save the configuration.
. Make sure the job was successful:

NOTE: You can add new repositories, update existing ones, or delete them as needed.

== Default Build configuration

This job allows you to define the default build parameters i.e. the repository URL, the branch, and environment to build to avoid having to re-enter the same parameters in the build job.

NOTE: You can use the build job without configuring your default build configuration.

. Click on the image:continuous-delivery:jenkins-play-button.png[CDPlayButton] of the "Configure my default build parameters - LivingApp" job.
. Enter the URL to your Bonita living application repository (e.g. "https://github.com/acme/myGreatLivingApp.git").
. Then enter the branch you will be building most of the time.
. Finally input the environment (as defined in your project) you will be used when building.
Your job should look like this:
image:build-default-parameters.png[BuildDefaultExample]
. Click on the "Build" button to save the configuration
. Make sure the job was successful:
image:def-build-job-result.png[JobResult]

== Default Deploy configuration

This job allows you to define the default build parameters i.e. the BCD Configuration and the target runtime (production, preproduction or integration).

NOTE: You can use the deploy job without configuring your default deploy configuration.

. Click on the image:continuous-delivery:jenkins-play-button.png[CDPlayButton] of the "Configure my default deploy parameters - LivingApp" job.
. Enter the BCD configuration you wish to use to deploy your default living application
. Select the runtime to deploy to.

NOTE: This job is only useful for versions of Bonita >= 2024.3/10.2.

NOTE: You can use the deploy-uib job without configuring your default build configuration.

. Click on the image:continuous-delivery:jenkins-play-button.png[CDPlayButton] of the "Configure my default deploy-uib parameters - LivingApp" job.
. Enter the URL to your Bonita living application repository (e.g. "https://github.com/acme/myGreatLivingApp.git").

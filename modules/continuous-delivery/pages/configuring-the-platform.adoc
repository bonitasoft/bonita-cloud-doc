CAUTION: If your Git repository is hosted on GitHub.com, beginning August 13, 2021 password-based authentication will no longer be accepted. Instead, token-based authentication will be required using a https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token[personal access token].

=== (optional) Load a custom Deployment Descriptor file

The BCD deploy command allows to add and extra parameter named `deploy.json` to specify which resources have to be deployed, and with which policy.
See xref:{bcdVersion}@bcd:ROOT:deployer.adoc#deployment_descriptor_file[Deploy Living App artifacts | Deployment Descriptor file] for more info.

When used, if a deploy policy is declared in DEPLOY_JSON, it overrides the Production Policies.

To use the deployment descriptor, enter the content of the deploy.json in the `DEPLOY_JSON` optional field.

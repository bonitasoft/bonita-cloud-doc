# Disater recovery
A disaster is any unplanned event that causes the total interruption of the customer production runtime.

The goal of our disaster recovery plan is to guarantee the continuity of the customer business.

In case of disaster, Bonitasoft targets for its production runtime:

* To recover the service within 15 minutes (**R**ecovery **T**ime **O**bjective: 15 minutes)
> Recovery Time Objective or RTO is a metric that helps to calculate how quickly Bonitasoft targets to recover its IT infrastructure and services following a disaster in order to maintain the customer’s business continuity

* To limit the data loss to 1 minute (**R**ecovery **P**oint **O**bjective: 1 minute)
> Recovery Point Objective or RPO is a metric to define the maximum tolerable amount of data that can be lost following a disaster.
